# Django Delights Inventory and Sales Application

## Overview

Django Delights is an inventory and sales application designed for restaurant owners to keep track of their food inventory throughout the day. The application allows users to manage ingredients, recipes, and customer purchases, ensuring that the inventory is updated in real-time.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can log in, log out, and must be logged in to access the application views.
- **Menu Management**: Users can create, update, and delete items from the restaurant's menu.
- **Inventory Management**: Users can add ingredients to the restaurant's inventory, update their quantities, and set prices per unit.
- **Recipe Management**: Users can define the ingredients (and their quantities) required for each menu item.
